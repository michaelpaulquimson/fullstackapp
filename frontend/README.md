# Frontend (to be added)

This folder is reserved for your frontend application (e.g., Next.js, React, Vue, etc.).

## Quickstart
1. Scaffold your frontend app here (e.g., `npx create-next-app .` or `npx create-react-app .`).
2. Add a `Dockerfile` for your frontend build and runtime.
3. Update the root `docker-compose.yml` to add the frontend as a service.
4. Add setup and usage instructions to this README.

This monorepo is ready for full-stack, Docker-first development!
